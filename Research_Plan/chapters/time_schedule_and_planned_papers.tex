	The estimated time schedule for this research is depicted in the form of a Gantt chart in \cref{fig:Gantt Chart}. The following publications are planned :-
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Robust and accurate state estimation within farms, ICRA} : Performance of visual, inertial, GPS fusion based state estimator, comparison of ground truth to developed algorithm.
		\item \textbf{Spatio temporal environment modeling using data collected from a UAV, IROS / AgEng}: 3D reconstruction results based on captured image data using the UAV, visualisation of crop growth over time.
		\item \textbf{UAV based crop data collection and analysis, JFR} : Crop health indicators estimated from the developed combined state estimation and mapping framework including crop height, canopy cover, biomass, leaf area index and leaf green.
		\item \textbf{Performance and limitations of UAV based crop health indicators, RSS / FSR} : Comparison of UAV based crop health indicators with ground truth from the Field phenotyping platform.
		\item \textbf{Farm input management using UAV data: advantages and limitations, IJRR / PA / Remote Sensing}: Strategies to estimate farm inputs, e.g.. fertiliser from UAV estimated leaf green and weed pressure from dense 3D reconstructions, and their effectiveness on a real farm.
	\end{itemize}
