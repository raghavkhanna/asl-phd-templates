	Abstract = {This paper describes the dynamic window approach to reactivecollision
	avoidance for mobile robots equipped withsynchro-drives. The approach
	is derived directly from themotion dynamics of the robot and is therefore
	particularlywell-suited for robots operating at high speed. It differsfrom
	previous approaches in that the search for commandscontrolling the
	translational and rotationalvelocity of therobot is carried out directly
	in the space of velocities. Theadvantage of our approach is that
	it correctly and in anelegant way incorporatesthe dynamics of the
	robot. This isdone by reducing the search space to thedynamic window,which
	consists of the velocities reachable withina short timeinterval.
	Within the dynamic window the approach onlyconsidersadmissible velocities
	yielding a trajectory on whichthe robot is able tostop safely. Among
	these velocities thecombination of translational androtational velocity
	is chosenby maximizing an objective function. The objectivefunctionincludes
	a measure of progress towards a goal location, theforwardvelocity

	In extensive experiments theapproach presented here has been found

	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel randomized motion planner for robots that
	must achieve a
	
	specified goal under kinematic and/or dynamic motion constraints while
	avoiding collision
	
	with moving obstacles with known trajectories. The planner encodes
	the motion constraints
	
	on the robot with a control system and samples the robot's state 
	time space by picking control
	
	inputs at random and integrating its equations of motion. The result
	is a probabilistic roadmap
	
	of sampled state  time points, called milestones, connected by short
	admissible trajectories.
	
	The planner does not precompute the roadmap; instead, for each planning
	query, it generates a
	
	new roadmap to connect an initial and a goal state  time point. The
	paper presents a detailed
	
	analysis of the planner's convergence rate. It shows that, if the
	state  time space satisfies a
	
	geometric property called expansiveness, then a slightly idealized
	version of our implemented
	
	planner is guaranteed to find a trajectory when one exists, with probability
	quickly converging
	
	to 1, as the number of of milestones increases. Our planner was tested
	extensively not only in
	
	simulated environments, but also on a real robot. In the latter case,
	a vision module estimates
	
	obstacle motions just before planning starts. The planner is then
	allocated a small, fixed amount
	
	of time to compute a trajectory. If a change in the expected motion
	of the obstacles is detected
	
	while the robot executes the planned trajectory, the planner recomputes
	a trajectory on the fly.
	
	Experiments on the real robot led to several extensions of the planner
	in order to deal with time
	
	delays and uncertainties that are inherent to an integrated robotic
	system interacting with the
	
	physical world.},

	Abstract = {Autonomous planetary rovers operating in vast unknown
	
	environments must operate efficiently because of size,
	
	power and computing limitations. Recently, we have
	
	developed a rover capable of efficient obstacle avoidance
	
	and path planning. The rover uses binocular stereo vision
	
	to sense potentially cluttered outdoor environments. Navigation
	
	is performed by a combination of several modules
	
	that each {\`O}vote{\'O} for the next best action for the robot to
	
	execute. The key distinction of our system is that it produces
	
	globally intelligent behavior with a small computational
	
	resource{\~N} all processing and decision making is
	
	done on a single processor. These algorithms have been
	
	tested on our prototype rover, Bullwinkle, outdoors and
	
	have recently driven the rover 100 m at speeds of 15 cm/
	
	sec. In this paper we systems report on the extensions on
	
	that we have previously developed that were necessary to
	
	achieve autonomous navigation in this domain.},

@article{stentz95complete,
	Abstract = {Most autonomous outdoor navigation systems tested on actual robots
	have centered on local navigation tasks such as
	
	avoiding obstacles or following roads. Global navigation has been
	limited to simple wandering, path tracking,
	
	straight-line goal seeking behaviors, or executing a sequence of scripted
	local behaviors. These capabilities are
	
	insufficient for unstructured and unknown environments, where replanning
	may be needed to account for new
	
	information discovered in every sensor image. To address these problems,
	we have developed a complete system that
	
	integrates local and global navigation. The local system uses a scanning
	laser rangefinder to detect obstacles and
	
	recommend steering commands to ensure robot safety. These obstacles
	are passed to the global system which stores
	
	them in a map of the environment. With each addition to the map, the
	global system uses an incremental path
	
	planning algorithm to optimally replan the global path and recommend
	steering commands to reach the goal. An
	
	arbiter combines the steering recommendations to achieve the proper
	balance between safety and goal acquisition.
	
	This system was tested on a real robot and successfully drove it 1.4
	kilometers to find a goal given no a priori map of
	
	the environment.},

	The proposed method finds, like RANSAC, a solution that is optimal
	with user-controllable probability. A provably optimal model verification
	strategy is designed for the situation when the contamination of
	data by outliers is known, i.e. the algorithm is the fastest possible
	(on average) of all randomized RANSAC algorithms guaranteeing confidence
	in the solution. The derivation of the optimality property is based
	on Wald.s theory of sequential decision making. The R-RANSAC with
	SPRT, which does not require the a priori knowledge of the fraction
	of outliers and has results close to the optimal strategy, is introduced.
	We show experimentally that on standard test data the method is
	2 to 10 times faster than the standard RANSAC and up to 4 times
	faster than previously published methods.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of automatic construction of a hierarchical
	map from images. Our approach departs from a large collection of
	omnidirectional images taken at many locations in a building. First
	a low-level map is built that consists of a graph in which relations
	between images are represented. For this we use a metric based on
	visual landmarks (SIFT features) and geometrical constraints. Then
	we use a graph partitioning method to cluster nodes and in this
	way construct the high-level map. Experiments on real data show
	that meaningful higher and lower level maps are obtained, which
	can be used for accurate localization and planning.},
